"""Loading the processed splits that :mod:`scripts.build_dataset` produced.

Training consumes ``data/processed`` as a *contract*, not as a directory of loose
files. Four properties are checked on load, because each has a failure mode that
would otherwise show up as a plausible-looking but wrong metric:

1. **Presence.** Missing splits produce an actionable error naming the build
   command, rather than an opaque ``FileNotFoundError`` deep in a fit call.
2. **Integrity.** Each split file is re-hashed and compared against
   ``dataset_manifest.json``. A mismatch means the file changed after the build,
   so the manifest's provenance no longer describes what is about to be trained
   on. That is recorded loudly and carried into the run manifest.
3. **Text provenance.** ``record.text`` was composed at build time from
   ``text.fields``. If configuration has changed since, the model trains on the
   *old* field set while the run config advertises the new one. Recorded, not
   silently accepted.
4. **Label coverage.** Labels seen in the splits are checked against the saved
   vocabulary, whose index order is the class order every confusion matrix and
   every saved model uses.

Only presence is fatal. The rest are recorded as findings so an operator sees
them in the log and in ``run_manifest.json`` — a stale-but-usable dataset should
produce a loud run, not a refusal.

**No feature extraction happens here.** Text arrives as text; the vectorizer is
fitted inside the pipeline on the training split alone (master spec §9).
