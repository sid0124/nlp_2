"""Reading a finished training run as a queryable object.

The API trains nothing. It reads a ``results/<run_id>/`` directory produced by
``scripts/train_baseline.py`` and answers the dashboard's questions from those
artifacts plus the processed dataset the run was trained on. That split of
responsibility is deliberate: training is a batch job with a seed and a
manifest, and an HTTP request is the wrong place to start one.

What a loaded run can answer, and what it genuinely cannot:

==================== ======================================================
Answerable           Source
==================== ======================================================
Corpus composition   ``dataset_manifest.json`` + the split files
Per-paper prediction ``predictions_<split>.jsonl`` — written at train time
Headline metrics     ``metrics.json``
Ad-hoc classification ``model.joblib`` — a real forward pass on new text
Nearest neighbours   cosine distance in the run's own fitted TF-IDF space
Term contributions   ``tfidf_value * coefficient`` for the predicted class
==================== ======================================================

Not answerable, and reported as unavailable rather than approximated:
**section-level attention** (needs the Milestone 3 hierarchical model),
**grounded question answering** (needs a retrieval index), and **semantic
embedding similarity** (TF-IDF overlap is lexical, not learned — master
spec §17).

Predictions are read from disk rather than recomputed. The file was written by
the run being described, so a number shown in the dashboard is the same number
that appears in ``report.md``; recomputing invites the two to disagree.
