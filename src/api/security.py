"""Request-level protections for the API (master spec §40).

Four independent measures, each covering something the others do not:

* **API key** — an optional shared secret, checked in constant time. Optional is
  the honest design for a loopback dev server; what matters is that turning it on
  is a single environment variable rather than a code change, so the deployment
  path does not require inventing an auth layer under time pressure.
* **Body size limit** — enforced from ``Content-Length`` *before* the body is
  read, so an oversized request costs a header parse rather than memory.
* **Security headers** — a small fixed set, aimed at what this app actually does:
  it serves its own static dashboard and returns JSON.
* **Filename sanitising** — unused today, because there is no upload endpoint.
  Kept here, tested, so that when the PDF phase lands the helper already exists
  and the temptation to inline ``Path(filename).name`` and call it done does not
  arise.

There is deliberately **no upload endpoint**. Master spec §40 requires validated,
size-limited, isolated document handling and "never trust uploaded PDF content";
none of that is buildable before the parser exists, and an endpoint that accepts
a file it cannot safely process is worse than a button that says "not yet".
