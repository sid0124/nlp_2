"""FastAPI application factory.

Assembled here rather than at module scope so that tests can build an app against
a temporary results directory, and so a second app in the same interpreter does
not inherit the first one's cached settings.

Two decisions worth stating.

**The dashboard is served from the API's own origin.** ``server.serve_frontend``
mounts ``frontend/`` at ``/``. A same-origin ``fetch`` is not a cross-origin
request, so in the default configuration CORS never enters the picture — which
removes the opportunity to make the usual mistake of opening the API to ``*``
while debugging and shipping it that way (master spec §40). The CORS middleware is
still installed for the separate-dev-server case, but only with explicitly listed
origins.

**Middleware order is deliberate.** Starlette runs middleware outermost-first in
the order added, so the size limit is added last and therefore runs first: an
oversized body is refused before CORS or header logic touches it.

_DESCRIPTION = """
Read-only API over a completed training run.

It trains nothing: `scripts/train_baseline.py` writes a run to `results/<run_id>/`
and this service reads it. Endpoints that need a model load the run's own
`model.joblib`, so an ad-hoc classification uses exactly the estimator the
reported metrics describe.

Features that are not built report `available: false` with a reason rather than
returning approximations. `GET /api/meta` lists them.
