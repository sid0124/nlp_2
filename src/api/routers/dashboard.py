"""Dashboard aggregates: the stat row, the domain donut, and the trends chart.

Every number here is computed from the active run's artifacts and the corpus it
was trained on. Nothing is estimated, and nothing is compared against a previous
period — there is only one run in view, so a trend arrow would have nothing behind
it. Where a panel in the original design needed data this system does not have,
the panel's payload says so rather than approximating.
