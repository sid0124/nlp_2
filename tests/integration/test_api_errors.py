"""What the API does when a request is wrong, unauthorised, or unanswerable.

The contract tests cover the shapes a working request produces. These cover the
other half, which is the half a client actually has to program against: a
dashboard needs to distinguish "no run trained yet" from "that paper does not
exist" from "your key is wrong", and it can only do that if each failure is
distinct, uniform, and stable.

Four groups, each protecting a decision that would be easy to erode:

* **One error envelope.** Every deliberate failure carries ``error`` and
  ``detail``, so the frontend has one error path rather than three.
* **Refusal beats fabrication.** ``/ask`` returns 501 with master spec §20's exact
  sentence. A plausible generated answer with no retrieval behind it is the single
  outcome that specification forbids, and the test pins the wording verbatim.
* **Degraded, not broken.** With no run, or a run missing its model, the API stays
  up and reports what is missing. Panels that need nothing but the corpus keep
  working.
* **Security responses are still API responses.** A 401 or a 413 carries the same
  envelope and the same headers as a 200.
