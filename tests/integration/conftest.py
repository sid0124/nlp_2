"""Fixtures for the API contract tests.

Building a client means training a real run. The API reads run artifacts, so a
test against a hand-written manifest would prove nothing about what the dashboard
actually receives — it would only prove that a fixture matches itself.

Two runs are trained once per session, one per confidence kind. That is not
duplication for its own sake: LinearSVC's unbounded decision margin and logistic
regression's probability take different paths through the review threshold, the
``confidence_kind`` field, and the classification caveat, and the frontend renders
them with different geometry. A suite that only ever saw one of them would let the
other break silently.

Everything is offline and writes only under ``tmp_path_factory``, so no test run
ever leaves a directory in the repository's own ``results/``.
