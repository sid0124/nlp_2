"""The API contract the dashboard is built against.

Every assertion here corresponds to something the frontend does with the payload.
That is the selection rule: if breaking a field would leave the dashboard showing
a wrong number rather than an obvious blank, it is pinned here.

Three of those obligations are worth naming, because they are the ones a
plausible-looking refactor breaks without failing anything else:

* **The review threshold is derived on the server** (master spec §15). The client
  receives ``needs_review`` as a boolean and never re-derives it, so the threshold
  has one home. :func:`test_needs_review_matches_the_configured_threshold` checks
  the flag against the configured number rather than against itself.
* **Training-split rows carry no prediction.** The model was fitted on them, so a
  score there is not evidence. The API returns nulls, and the dashboard renders
  "not scored" — an easy thing to "fix" into a leak.
* **A score is labelled by kind.** A decision margin is not a probability, and
  ``confidence_kind`` is what stops the UI printing "64%" for an unbounded number.

Read alongside ``test_api_errors.py``, which covers what happens when a request is
wrong, unauthorised, oversized, or arrives with nothing trained.
